                <p>
                    CleanTech is an AI-powered platform designed to automate the classification of municipal waste
                    using cutting-edge deep learning and transfer learning techniques.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to streamline waste segregation at the source, reduce landfill waste, and promote sustainability.
                    This web app uses a trained image classification model to help users easily categorize different types of waste.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The model was built using transfer learning on a curated dataset of municipal solid waste. We aim to extend this
                    system into mobile and real-time use cases for municipalities and communities worldwide.
